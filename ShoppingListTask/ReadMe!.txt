This is demonstration of a sample of my knowledge about Microsoft MVC, entity framework and 
supporting technology.

The work is an example of implementing a model and a small set of controllers with the use of
the repository pattern to clarify the code.  A commercial grade application would be written with 
more attention to controllers that are reusable across many applications and error protection
logic and testing would need to be extensively implemented.

The code assumes that you have SQL Express installed on the local computer and if so, 
will create a tiny database on your machine.

For "fun" you can change your user id using the top left portion navigation bar and the 
application will partition the shopping basket table so that each user has their own
shopping basket.  The demonstration does not create a user table nor deal with password etc.
to keep things short, but that could be added easily.

The code should give a positive indication of my abilities.  There are sections of comments
for you to look at as examples of the practice.

Kind regards
