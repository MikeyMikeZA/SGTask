# Demo of a Shopping Basket type application.

This is an indication of my abillities to work with C#, MVC, EF and MS-SQL Express.
The application is best run from inside VS 2017 with SQl Express installed on the local host with the current user having System Admin rights on the SQL Installation.

This is purely a demo and is not to be thought of as a complete nor production grade example.

Areas that can be developed further:
a) Extensive error management
b) Unit testing
c) The addition of partial views to simplify the architecture 
d) Usage of client side and server side validation of within the combination of partial views and standard views
e) AJAX to perform updaing status information etc on the various views
f) Extensive and consistent commenting

The code does have some comments in it already for your amusement

Kind regards
MIke Howell
